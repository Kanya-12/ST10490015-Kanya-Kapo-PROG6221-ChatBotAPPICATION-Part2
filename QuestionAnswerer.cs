                { "how to avoid phishing", "Avoid phishing by checking sender addresses, not following links in unsolicited messages, hovering over links to see actual URLs, verifying requests by phone, and using email filters and 2FA." },
                { "spear phishing", "Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific person or organization, often using personal details. Be cautious with unexpected messages and verify requests independently." },
                { "phishing signs", "Common phishing signs: sender address mismatch, urgent language, unexpected attachments, poor grammar, suspicious URLs, and requests for credentials or money." },

                // Passwords
